# Data Science Portfolio

Below are a list of projects I have been working on lately with the goal of developing my data science skills. 

## Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk

-[My project](Kaggle_Home_Credit_Default_Risk/) 

Please note that many csv files are beyond GitHubs upload limitations. In order to preserve the project structure as much as possible I uploaded what I could. If there is a csv file missing, it is because it was above the limit. All essential notebooks and code are in the directory.
