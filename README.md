# Data Science Portfolio

Below are a list of (personal) projects I have been working on lately with the goal of developing my data science skills. 

## Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)
This was my first "real" data science project. 



## Comparing long-term weather forecasts (In Progress)
A common debate in our household is whether it is worth commiting to long-term plans that are highly weather dependent. In order to address this question I decided to see just how accurate some popular weather websites are with their forecasts. Unfortunately I could not find any saved long term forecasts, so I decided to write a program to scrape daily forecasts. That program is collecting data now and when I have enough data I will start to analyze and post the results here.
