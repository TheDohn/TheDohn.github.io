# Data Science Portfolio

Below are a list of projects I have been working on lately with the goal of developing my data science skills. 

## Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk

-[Original Kaggle Competition Description and Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

-[My project](Kaggle_Home_Credit_Default_Risk/)


- This was my first "real" data science project that wasn't simply a textbook or website exercise.

- Please note that many csv files are beyond GitHubs upload limitations. In order to preserve the project structure as much as possible I uploaded what I could. If there is a csv file missing, it is because it was above the limit. All essential notebooks and code are in the directory.


## Comparing long-term weather forecasts(In Progress)
