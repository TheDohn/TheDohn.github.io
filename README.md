# Data Science Portfolio

Below are a list of projects I have been working on lately with the goal of developing my data science skills. Many of the iPython notebooks are large enough that they will not display in Github, and you will have to download them to view them. 

## Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk

-[Original Kaggle Competition Description and Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

-[My project](Kaggle_Home_Credit_Default_Risk/) 

Please note that many csv files are beyond GitHubs upload limitations. In order to preserve the project structure as much as possible I uploaded what I could. If there is a csv file missing, it is because it was above the limit. All essential notebooks and code are in the directory.
