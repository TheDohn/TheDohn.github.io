# Data Science Portfolio

Below are a list of projects I have been working on lately with the goal of developing my data science skills. 

## [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)
This was my first "real" data science project that wasn't simply a textbook or website exercise.

UPDATES ARE IN PROGRESS

- Unfortunately I do not see anyway of making the entire project available here since it is 6GB+ and Github places an unofficial limit of 1GB per repository, so I have put some representative files here in order to demonstrate my thought process throughout the project.

## Comparing long-term weather forecasts (In Progress)
- A common debate in our household is whether it is worth commiting to long-term plans that are highly weather dependent. i.e. should we make nonrefundable reservations on a Monday for the following Sunday?

In order to address this question I decided to see just how accurate some popular weather websites forecasts are. While it was unfortunate that I could not find any saved long term forecasts, it was a great exercise to write a program to scrape daily forecasts. That program is collecting data now and when I have enough data I will start to analyze and post the results here.
