## Comparing long-term weather forecasts

A common debate in our household is whether it is worth commiting to long-term plans that are highly weather dependent. i.e. should we make nonrefundable reservations on a Monday for the following Sunday? In order to address this question I decided to see just how accurate some popular weather website's forecasts are. I could not find any saved long term forecasts, and many weather APIs are limited in their scope, so I wrote some code to scrape forecasts from a variety of popular weather websites. That code is in notebook form in this directory. That program is collecting data now and when I have enough data I will start to analyze and post the results here.
