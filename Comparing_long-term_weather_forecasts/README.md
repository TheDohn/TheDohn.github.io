## Comparing long-term weather forecasts

A common debate in our household is whether it is worth commiting to long-term plans that are highly weather dependent. i.e. should we make nonrefundable reservations on a Monday for the following Sunday? In order to address this question I decided to see just how accurate some popular weather website's forecasts are. While it was unfortunate that I could not find any saved long term forecasts, it was a great exercise to write a program to scrape daily forecasts, and that notebook is in this directory. That program is collecting data now and when I have enough data I will start to analyze and post the results here. Update 11/182018: Weatherunderground was not cooperating but I think I have all the kinks worked and am running the code <em>now</em>.
