# Top 20 Tweets D3 Project 1:

The project just appears as a html file and csv file in this folder. To display as an normal webpage [follow this link.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TheDohn/TheDohn.github.io/blob/master/Twitter_Elections_Integrity_Archive/Project1_Twitter_Elections_Integrity_Archive.html) I suggest using Chrome to view the webpage. Sometimes the page does require a reload when first viewing (I do not believe this is an error in my code). You should see some text, and 3 drop down menus to manipulate data presented as blue blocks. Note that I have deactivated any hyperlinks by changing https -> hssqs. If you wish to follow the original links, do so at your own risk.

The final presentation is close to what I set out to produce, but there are still some improvements to be made. For example, this project could be extended to include the ability to input any equation of the attributes (including more attributes and things like Logarithms etc). Seeing the final product made me realize that representing the attributes geometrically as I have limits the number of accounts that can be displayed, and so this is as far as I will go with this project (although I am thinking about other smaller data sets that could be usefully displayed in this way). Also, most people are not going to be interested in things like ratios of numerical attributes. Most people are probably more interested in the tweets themselves, so my next project is to find a way to search through and group the tweet content. 


# Top 1000 Tweets D3 Project 2:

NOTE: The code IS NOT fully optimized, commented etc. as I am just posting it for feedback and then I will finalize the project. 

The project just appears as a html file and csv file in this folder. To display as an normal webpage [follow this link.](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TheDohn/TheDohn.github.io/blob/master/Twitter_Elections_Integrity_Archive/Project2_Twitter_Elections_Integrity_Archive.html) I suggest using Chrome to view the webpage. Sometimes the page does require a reload when first viewing (I do not believe this is an error in my code). You should see some text, and 2 drop down menus to manipulate data presented as circles and pies charts. Note that I have deactivated any hyperlinks by changing https -> hssqs. If you wish to follow the original links, do so at your own risk.

I consider this project a great improvement on my first attempt (above) as it displays the information in a manner than encourages exploration.
